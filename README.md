# Baseball Player Batting Performance

This project uses data visualization techniques to help investigate the existence of a relation between a baseball player batting batting performance and some features like batting hand, weight and height.

This task involves:
* Encode data using optimal visual elements
* Assess the effectiveness of the visualization
* Support interaction to help communicate what was found
* Undergo the iterative process of creatinf a visualization using dimple.js and d3.js.

This project was part of my Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity.
